# PhoneGallery
Developing Phone Gallery using AngularJS.

**Safety first**

On the side, before actually getting into AngularJS (and JS in general), before installing any software module using npm, make sure to issue following command: **npm config set ignore-scripts true**. It's important to care for safety first, then, care for the project,  and finally care for succesful maintenance and so on.

I will be following tutorial from official Angular web site, variations are possible as I go along with the project.
